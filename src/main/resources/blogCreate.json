  "description": "I lost money as I got into the scam. There is a bunch of people (gang) as one of them will contact you and sell the idea of teaching crypto investment by opening a VIP account (only privliged). Later you will be asked to put money for trade and will also help you to trade at certain point in time of the day. You will consistently see that your balance/position goes up in the exchange in order to boost your confidence with a hope that you will be able to withdraw your coins one day (with profit). Later when time comes and you wanted to withdraw then the whole scam is revealed -- <br/><br/>1. Exchange (customer care) will ask you to add money for verification as without which no withdrawal of coins could happen.<br/>2. After adding money for verification, then when you ask if you could withdraw - they will ask you to cover the trade volume. You then have to trade compulsory in the hope that you could withdraw your coins.<br/>3. Then if you succeed & made an attempt then you will be asked to pay crypto tax as without that you cannot withdraw coins.<br/><br/>All in all - it is a big scam - stay stay away from this dodgy (legit looking website) if you do not want to loose your hard earned money.",
